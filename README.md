# Setaliases

Sets your Windows Cmder aliases from a given URL.

This can be used to sync your aliases from a remote source (eg. Gist) to your all your devices running Cmder.

## Requirements
- Cmder
- PHP 7.1 or above (PHP 8 works).

âš  This only works for [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) or other windows terminals that uses 'alias' and automatically saves the aliases.
